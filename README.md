Gem Raider

Gem Raider is a simple 2D action-adventure game centered around hunting for treasure. The objective of this game is to find and collect all the gems scattered around the map while avoiding environmental hazards and dangerous wildlife.

Basic movement is accomplished using the AWSD, awds, or arrow keys. The left mouse button will pick up items, and the right mouse button will dig for items. 

The key to survival is maneuvering around hazardous areas and avoiding dangerous creatures wandering the area. But that isnâ€™t all. The player must find all the gems before the environment becomes too unstable. There are three levels, each requiring you to find more gems in a shorter time. 

There is no time to waste; it is time to get Raiding!
